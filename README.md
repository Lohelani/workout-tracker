# Workout-Tracker

### _Created by: Lohelani Hicks

## Requirements 

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

## Description and Method

For this application I used mongoDB to create a database that would track the users workouts and progress by adding up the totals for the time a user worked out(duration), the distance they may have traveled if doing cardio, and the total number of weight lifted for the past seven workouts. I used router for the routes, mongoose for the schema, and heroku to connect launch the application. User also has the option to view all the toals on the stats page which gives them a visual for their progress.
